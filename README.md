# iMemory
Concentration game built in Swift - to reach the final round of interviews with Apple, just like many other places, you have to complete a code challenge. The requirements were as follows:

# Requirements

- Standard memory card game, sometimes known as concentration
- We want a built application, in Xcode that runs on iPhone X.
- No Storyboard.
- Don’t care on language preference

# App Should

- Display your score (number of moves it took you to complete the game)
- Start a new game (user should be able to select N which also defines the complexity for the game)
- The game state should persist
- Profile view that shows a history table of all your past game scores
- Code should include mock function to send state to a server (obviously there is no server but the function would get as far as needed until the “send data” spot)


# Quickly Customize

- For quick customization, clone this repository and swap out the images in the Assets folder. Change the background, front and back of the cards, and the app icon!
